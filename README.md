<br>
This repository contains a web service that uses a machine learning approach to make accurate predictions of wind turbine power from given wind speed
based on the data set powerproduction. 

The project has the following features:

* Jupyter notebook with three machine learning models trained on the data set _powerproduction_.
* Python script running a web service based on the best performing model.
* DockerÔ¨Åle that builds and runs the web service in a container.

###  How to run the code
___

1. Make sure that you have Python installed
2. Download or clone current repository "Machine-Learning-and-Statistics-Project"
3. Open Command Interpreter and get into correct directory
4. Install packages and run the app: 
    * If using a virtual environment: 

        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        export FLASK_APP=flask_server
        python3 -m flask run
        ```

        # Windows
        ```bash
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        set FLASK_APP=flask_server
        python -m flask run
        ```
    * If using Docker:

        ```bash
        docker build . -t wind-power
        docker run -d -p 5000:5000 wind-power
        ```
        In case of an error, change the first line of the Docker file for your version of Python.
5. To view the model analysis run Jupyter Notebook and open Power_production_models.ipynb.
