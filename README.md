This repository contains a web service that uses a machine learning approach to make accurate predictions of wind turbine power from given wind speed
based on the data set powerproduction. 

The project has the following features:

* Jupyter notebook with three machine learning models trained on the data set _powerproduction_.
* Python script running a web service based on the best performing model.
* DockerÔ¨Åle that builds and runs the web service in a container.


*Submitted by:* Olga Rozhdestvina (Student No: G00387844)
